###scheme-interpreter

As a part of one of my introductory computer science classes at UC Berkeley, I wrote the core backend for a Scheme interpreter in Python. [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language), a dialect of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language), is a functional programming language. 
To use this interpreter, simply navigate to the project folder in Terminal using ...
```
cd PATH/scheme-interpreter
```
... and run an interactive interpreter with the command ...
```
python scheme.py
```

To exit the interpreter simply type...
```scheme
(exit)
```
Here is a link to the [documentation for Scheme](https://cs61a.org/articles/scheme-spec.html).

Many thanks to the CS61A course staff for the starter code and support throughout this interesting project.
